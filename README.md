# Hadamard-Gate-GUI-Learning-Tool
Created as Spring 2020 Project for R-labs 
Project uses pygame library to move qubit into the Hadamard Gate. There is a key at the bottom that tells the viewer what state of qubit it is.
The changing of the colors represent that the qubit state is changing before it goes through the hadamard gate and is measured. 
This is a gamified way to learn how a qubit is effected as it goes though the gate. The gamification is that the user needs to aim to qubit on to the gate. 
This can be applied to learn how other quantum gates work as well.
Code of bubble shoot game was reffered to while creating this gui.
